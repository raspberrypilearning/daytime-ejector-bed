+ Upgrade to a 30 minute gradual tip up at sunrise for a more gentle wake up
+ Change the latitude and longitude to tell you when it’s sunrise and sunset in a location you’ve always wanted to visit
+ Reset the bed to lying position at a set time in the afternoon for a short siesta (but remember to tip it again as it's not the end of the day)
