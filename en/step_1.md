## Introduction

Using a Raspberry Pi Build HAT and LEGO® Technic™ motor, make a LEGO bed that tips up at sunrise to stop a minifigure sleeping through the day. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
The <span style="color: #0faeb0">**Raspberry Pi Build HAT**</span> fits on top of a Raspberry Pi Computer and can control up to four LEGO® Technic™ motors and sensors at the same time.
</p>

You will:
+ Connect a **Raspberry Pi Build HAT** to the **Raspberry Pi computer** and interact with a LEGO® build
+ Program a **LEGO® Technic™ motor** using the **Python buildhat library**
+ Use Python **time** objects to calculate differences and delay outputs

To complete this project you will need the following hardware:
+ A Raspberry Pi computer 
+ A Raspberry Pi Build HAT
+ A 7.5V power supply with a barrel jack
+ A LEGO® Technic™ motor
+ An assortment of LEGO® (from the LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime kit or other LEGO® sets)
